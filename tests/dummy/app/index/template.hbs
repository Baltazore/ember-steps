      Hey! Thanks for checking out <b>ember-wizard</b>!  I hope you find it an easy-to-use but powerful
      means for creating multi-step flows through your Ember application.

      Below is the most basic usage of the addon â€“ a simple series of steps, with a single button to
      cycle through them.  Check out the links in the header above for more advanced features and
      their usage.
